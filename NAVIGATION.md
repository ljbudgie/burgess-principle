# NAVIGATION — Where to go, by what you need

This repository holds one question and everything built to support it:

> **"Was a human member of the team able to personally review the specific facts of my specific situation?"**

There are a lot of files here. You do not need most of them. Find your row
below, read the one or two documents it names, and ignore the rest until you
need it.

- **New to the project?** [START_HERE.md](./START_HERE.md) is the shortest way in.
- **Wondering what is Core versus optional?** [TIERS.md](./TIERS.md).
- **Looking for a sibling repository or hosted service?** [ECOSYSTEM.md](./ECOSYSTEM.md).

> **Companion documents:** this file routes readers to the right entry point.
> [TIERS.md](./TIERS.md) maps the tiers *inside* this repository.
> [ECOSYSTEM.md](./ECOSYSTEM.md) maps the *sibling repositories* around it.

## Entry points

### 1. Something has already happened to me and I need to act

You do not need to read anything else first. You need to ask the question in
writing.

**Start at [GETTING_STARTED.md](./GETTING_STARTED.md)** — copy-paste letters,
and the next step after you send one.

If that is not quite your situation:

- [START_HERE.md](./START_HERE.md) — the test in one screen, if you want the
  shape of it first.
- [templates/COMMON_SCENARIOS.md](./templates/COMMON_SCENARIOS.md) — routes you
  to the right letter.
- [START_HERE_DEBT_LETTERS.md](./START_HERE_DEBT_LETTERS.md) — debt and
  enforcement letters.
- [REGISTER.md](./REGISTER.md) — the standing letter register: field, tenor, mode, and the three lines.
- [Iris](./iris.html) — an assistant that already knows the framework.
- [Loop Storyboard](./loop-storyboard.html) — first-run walkthrough of institutional delay patterns.

### 2. I have an access need

[ACCESSIBILITY.md](./ACCESSIBILITY.md) — a plain-language route in, written for
deaf, blind, neurodivergent, and chronically ill readers, including reasonable
adjustments under Equality Act 2010 ss.20/21 and the anticipatory duty that runs
before you have to ask.

### 3. I am a lawyer, barrister, or policy professional

1. [LEGAL_FOUNDATIONS.md](./LEGAL_FOUNDATIONS.md) — *Ahmed*, *Majera*, DUAA 2025
   s.80, EA 2010, in one document.
2. [LEGAL_MAPPING.md](./LEGAL_MAPPING.md) — the full statutory and regulatory
   map, and the index to every jurisdiction-specific mapping.
3. [ADM_HUMAN_REVIEW.md](./ADM_HUMAN_REVIEW.md) — the human review mandate in
   detail.

### 4. I am an institution or compliance officer

1. [ONE_PAGE_BRIEF.md](./ONE_PAGE_BRIEF.md) — what the standard asks of you.
2. [CERTIFICATION_TIERS.md](./CERTIFICATION_TIERS.md) and
   [CERTIFICATION_MARK.md](./CERTIFICATION_MARK.md) — the mark, and what
   authorised use requires.
3. [adoption/BURGESS_READY_CHECKLIST.md](./adoption/BURGESS_READY_CHECKLIST.md)
   — a practical self-assessment.

### 5. I am a developer or AI builder

1. [verifiable_oversight/](./verifiable_oversight/) — the reference
   implementation: `BinaryTest`, SHA-256 fingerprinted `DecisionRecord`, and an
   append-only hash-chained store. Standard library only.
2. [verify_scrutiny.py](./verify_scrutiny.py) — the smallest runnable form of
   the test.
3. [INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md](./INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md) and
   [schemas/](./schemas/) — the data contracts.
4. [TIERS.md](./TIERS.md) — take Core alone if that is all you need.

### 6. I am an AI model, or an agent working on this repository

- **Replying to a human about the Principle:**
  [FOR_AI_MODELS.md](./FOR_AI_MODELS.md) — the binary test, the eight evasion
  patterns, routing, and the anti-monetisation guardrails.
- **Editing files or opening a PR here:** [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) — the rules,
  the checklist, and the Burgess Compliance Note every PR must carry.
- **Short drop-in prompts:** [iris/prompts/](./iris/prompts/),
  [prompts/](./prompts/), [llms.txt](./llms.txt).

### 7. I am a journalist, researcher, or academic

1. [ONE_PAGE_BRIEF.md](./ONE_PAGE_BRIEF.md) — framework, legal basis, and routes
   on one page.
2. [audits/LIVE_AUDIT_LOG.md](./audits/LIVE_AUDIT_LOG.md) and
   [live_findings_ledger.csv](./live_findings_ledger.csv) — the live evidence
   record.
3. [case-studies/](./case-studies/) — resolved and in-progress cases.
4. [papers/](./papers/) — the doctrinal papers.
5. [CITATION.cff](./CITATION.cff) — machine-readable citation metadata.

## Housekeeping notes

Building this index surfaced a small number of overlaps — `SOUL.md` against
[STATUS.md](./STATUS.md), `AGENT.md` against `AGENTS.md`, and several competing
routing surfaces. Each needs an owner decision, so they are tracked as open
items in [STATUS.md](./STATUS.md#documentation-structure--open-decisions) rather
than buried here. [LIVE_AUDIT_LOG.md](./LIVE_AUDIT_LOG.md) is the working
example of the pattern any move should follow: leave a short pointer at the old
path rather than deleting it. The pattern is written down in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#moving-or-renaming-a-file-the-pointer-pattern).
